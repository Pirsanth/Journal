# Journal
A fullstack online journal with Node.js and MongoDB. I have successfully updated the data model and am now working on adding user authentication.

## Checklist
- [x] Change code to work with new MongoDB data model then add git tags for the older model, delete oldModel branch (use tag to remember instead) and fast-forward merge master to new model branch
- [x] Finish DELETE and PUT requests to complete REST API
- [x] Add authentication with either cookies of JSON web token and make a login page (choose to go with sessions'based authentication)
- [ ] Add form validation for the frontend
- [ ] Hash passwords && protect from regexDOS
- [ ] Jazz up frontend
- [ ] Reflect on the project and update readme.md with a debreif
